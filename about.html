      <h1>Haydy Abdalla</h1>

      <p>
        Hello, my name is Haydy Abdalla. I am currently attending NJIT and am majoring in Information Systems. I have
        experience with html, css, python. Recently this year I have also worked with Webstorm, Git, GitHub, and
        boilerplate. I did not suddenly become interested in this field in a single moment; it slowly grew over
        time. Before, when I was on the other side of the stage, a part of the audience, a user who simply consumed
        things that IT technicians, software developers, web developers etc., created, I didn't think much about what
        went on behind the scenes and simply enjoyed the cool features my smartphone. I was amazed by how coding could
        be used to build almost anything and how anyone could do it if they applied themselves and worked to learn the
        coding required to accomplish their goal. The only limit is your own motivation and perseverance. As the time
        passes by, the society we live in becomes more and more reliant on technology and it will continue. I want to
        be a part of that world and be personally involved in the monumental movements that are being made to change
        the society we are living in, for the present and what it means for the future.

      <p>
        My name is Paulina Ortiz-Candelejo. I was born and raised in Newark, New Jersey and I am the first in my family
        to pursue a higher education in STEM. I am a self taught Graphic Designer, a Latina, a proud Newarker and an
        aspiring UX Designer. I am a Human Computer Interaction major at NJIT('22). I chose to study HCI because I
        wanted a major with a fusion of technology and graphic design. I understand the need for technological
        advancement and I am eager to contribute to that field using my talent in graphic design. I aspire to be a UX Designer and redesign outdated
        systems and create new ones to ease the user experience. As the same time I plan on using the knowledge I am going to gain over the
        next few years at NJIT to create business models that have social impact in mind. My ultimate goal is to make
        an impact in Latin America. To provide sources of income through employment to historically oppressed communities. I believe
        technology is the going to help me make that goal possible.
